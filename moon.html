    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about the Moon—Earth's original 'night light' and the only celestial body with a permanent 0-star rating for atmosphere.
As of 2026, the Moon is still playing hard to get. It's currently drifting away from us at about 1.5 inches per year. At this rate, in a few billion years, it'll be 'ghosting' us entirely, which is probably for the best considering how many 3:00 AM existential crises it has to listen to.
Technically, the Moon isn't even a perfect sphere; it's actually shaped like a lemon with a bulge on one side. It also has a very strange 'interior design' aesthetic—currently, there are 96 bags of human waste left up there by astronauts. It's essentially the solar system's most exclusive, high-altitude landfill.
Despite its glowing reputation, the Moon is a bit of a poser. It doesn't actually produce any light of its own; it just reflects the Sun's rays with the efficiency of worn asphalt. Plus, if you ever visit, bring a jacket: the temperature swings from a blistering 260°F during the day to a bone-chilling -280°F at night.
But we keep going back! In fact, 2026 is a big year for lunar fans, with 13 full moons on the calendar—including a rare 'Blue Moon' in May. So, the next time you look up, remember: it's beautiful, it's lemon-shaped, and it's carrying a century's worth of golf balls and trash. Thank you!</p>
